        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Fahim Imtiaz Shaown, I am an under graduate in Bsc (cse).I am a dedicated and hard work     person instance like I wanted to become an athlete and started my training initially. I was lacking in confidence in myself then I came to know that I am the best motivator and trainer of myself and started to sweat a lot and spend more time on the track.
            I am a person who is ready to learn anything from anyone without any kind of hesitancy. Being a quick learner is my strength. I give importance to everyone and each individual as their own strength and  I try to get inspired by them. A true inspiration for me is my friend who is a hard worker and self-motivated person who guides me in all aspects.I engage myself in activities like swimming, cooking, fishing, drawing, listening to music etc. My weakness is I used to get emoted quickly when some of the incidents that I come across, But now, I have managed it a lot by the guidance of my friends.
           Thank you</p>
